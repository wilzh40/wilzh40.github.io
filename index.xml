      <description>After 5 (or is it 6?) months of social isolation, I realized I had an overflowing surplus of time. After a brief relapse into Warcraft III, I decided that surplus time could be better invested elsewhere. That &amp;ldquo;elsewhere&amp;rdquo; turned out to be music.
I wanted to get better at sound design and learn how to recreate song I like. Yesterday, I had an epiphany: I knew how to code. The following script takes a youtube URL and extracts the stems&amp;ndash;vocals, bassline, drums, and other stuff&amp;ndash;into a predetermined folder.</description>

      <title>Solo Travel: Why?</title>

      <description>Context I recently embarked on a journey circumnavigating the world from 1/3/19 to 4/15/19. By writing this series of blog posts, I hope to accomplish several things:
 This blog post serves as a way to unpackage all the thoughts floating rent-free in my head, patiently waiting to be captured by the written word. If I don&amp;rsquo;t write these down, they&amp;rsquo;re going to fade away. It also serves as some sort of guide to future solo travelers (and my colleagues) who have asked me to document some of the findings on my trip, so that they would not repeat the same mistakes I did.</description>

      <title>Solo Travel: How?</title>

      <description>On Onebagging It is impractical to lug a 50-pound suitcase if you&amp;rsquo;re constantly moving across country lines. You want the option to carry all your shit with you. Dragging a suitcase across cobblestone streets and over muddy rivers really detracts from the overall travel experience. In addition, if you ever get mugged, you want the option of making a quick getaway. The solution was simple: stuff everything I needed for 3.</description>

      <description>On a bored Saturday, I realized that my old website (with all my iOS app descriptions and occasionally cringey high school blog posts) died when I spilled a cup of free coffee I got from the 6th floor of the Gates-Hillman center at CMU.
Most expensive cup of coffee in my life.
Now that I have a brand new laptop and hopefully much better coffee control, I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to create a new website.</description>
