<h2 id="context">Context</h2>

<p>For the last years, my best high school friend I would always take a picture of us in our ugly sweaters. Except this year, there was no holiday party for us to go to. This lead to.</p>

<p>It was a dark and stormy night.  For some reason, it was actually raining in bone-dry California. Occasional sirens were droning, fading into the distance, probably because people forgot how to drive when a single drop of water hit the roads. I would know because I was one of those people.</p>

<p>Fresh from the heartbreak of losing my Elephant car and tired of watching the same youtube videos over and over again, I looked my housemate in the eye. I wanted to do something fun!</p>

<p>My housemate and I were bored. I had a realization that I haven&rsquo;t coded &ldquo;for fun&rdquo; in 6 months ever since I started work. Each night I would write unit tests for the product I was working on. The purpose of this project was two-fold: to see if I still had the passion/drive to do something for myself, and rediscover the spark that drove me to program earlier.</p>

<p>I remember my commencement speaker for College (Leslie Odom Jr) uttered a quote that I truly resonated with. Something along the line of
&ldquo;Every day we try to recreate the spark we first felt&rdquo;</p>

<p>For me, that first spark was my first hackathon at CodeDay Silicon Valley 2015. I created an iphone app about a little dinosaur within 24 hours. I had a mentor that taught me the basics of command line and version control. I got a little wooden box inscribed with the words &ldquo;Best Game.&rdquo; I was hooked.</p>

<p>I kept on coding. I wanted to make things for fun. Not for money. But on pure unbridled passion. Of making and constructing things.</p>

<p>Flash forward 4 years of college, an acquistion, and I&rsquo;m .</p>

<p>I remember
The night
Leslie Odom Jr</p>
