<h2 id="context">Context</h2>

<p>I recently embarked on a journey circumnavigating the world from 1/3/19 to 4/15/19.
By writing this series of blog posts, I hope to accomplish several things:</p>

<ul>
<li>This blog post serves as a way to unpackage all the thoughts floating rent-free in my head, patiently waiting to be captured by the written word.</li>
<li>It also serves as some sort of guide to future solo travelers (and my colleagues) who have asked me to document some of the findings on my trip, so that they would not repeat the same mistakes I did. Although, there are a couple of solo travel communities online, there were a lot of lessons I learned through trial and error.</li>
<li>Lastly, it is some cathartic release for me to relive some of the memories as I sit here, drinking my $3.95 Gibraltar at one of the only hipster coffee shops in Fremont.</li>
</ul>

<p>The content is prosaic, kind of a stream-of-consciousness rant, so please forgive me in advance for all the grammarly offences I am about to commit. It&rsquo;s been four years since I took AP Lit&ndash; I&rsquo;m used to writing C, not English.</p>

<h2 id="the-motivation-why-solo-travel">The Motivation: Why Solo Travel?</h2>

<p>Solo Travel? Who the fuck does that? Do you have no friends? Aren&rsquo;t you gonna get lonely? You&rsquo;re gonna end up in a ditch somewhere on the other side of the world.</p>

<p>It took a lot of baby steps and twists of fate for me to buy that first airline ticket to Korea.</p>

<h3 id="inception">Inception</h3>

<p>It all started with this little thought in my mind. I was browsing a Reddit thread sometime probably in Junior year about the best underrated travel destinations in the world. And one of the top comments was Prague: beautiful, sprawling, old, cheap, and most importantly, unbombed during World War II. That was ground zero: it all started with this childlike inkling of desire to see Prague. But none of my friends wanted to see Prague. I brought it up in passing conversation. So I shelved that thought for a couple years.</p>

<h3 id="getting-tired-of-pittsburgh">Getting tired of Pittsburgh</h3>

<p>I was going through a conundrum sometime in the middle of November. I had just confirmed with my advisor that I had all of the required units to graduate one semester only. I originally had the naive thought that I would stay another semester part-time at CMU, thinking of course it was my senior spring. Instead, I would do research and take one high-level CS course in order to stay part-time and enrolled, preferably something that can prepare me for my upcoming job (C++).</p>

<p>That being said, I could still participate in Greek life and go to bars every Thursday, Friday, and Saturday, stumbling from Hofbrauhouse to Tiki Lounge to eventually one of the more degenerate (and never well-remembered) bacchanal known as Jimmy D&rsquo;s. On Fridays I would go to the Hidden Harbour happy hour and probably Mario&rsquo;s in Shadyside. On Saturdays, well, probably a frat party or two and then Tequila Cowboy. Rinse and repeat and rinse and repeat and so it goes. Cheap beer and top 40 and always ordering Dominoes by the end of the night.</p>

<p>I wasn&rsquo;t neccesarily sick of Pittsburgh, but I definitely sampled basically everything the Steel City had to offer. I had also accomplished most of my goals in college: I had a job, I passed all my classes, and I had a fairly diverse life outside of school. Subconsciouslly, I was spiritually ready to leave.</p>

<h3 id="youth">Youth</h3>

<p>Another thing I was slowly was growing concious of was the ephemeral nature of youth.
I had the opportunity to visit various alumni when I was interviewing for tech jobs in both San Francisco and Seattle, and all of them complained about how fun college was, and how shackled they felt to their 9-5 job. They missed the freedom of college. They missed the freedom of youth.
 A certain quote struck a chord with me &ndash; &ldquo;Youth is wasted on the young.&rdquo; This was going to the only time in my life where I had completely zero responsibility, beholden to no being nor syllabus, and I was going to take full advantage of that. True freedom.</p>

<h3 id="forcing-my-hand">Forcing my hand</h3>

<p>Sometime during mid-November, I was clutching an ice-cold bottle of Ace Pear Cider (top-tier beverage) at a late night gathering, eating smashed potato pizza. And I lost odds. Odds to just say &ldquo;fuck it and travel the world.&rdquo; Odds out of 3. I felt like the universe was definitely sending me a message.
So I instead of this abstraction I would sometimes daydream about while doing my CS homework, the possibility of saying &ldquo;fuck it&rdquo; and leaving wasn&rsquo;t just a pipe dream.</p>

<p>I started researching logistics. I started lurking in some travel communities, such as /r/solotravel. I called Fletcher (the only one who had the balls to do something similar) and interrogated him on his experience. I started doing some math and And then I realized, this was totally within the realm of possibility.</p>

<h3 id="nail-in-the-coffin">Nail in the coffin</h3>

<p>The nail in the coffin was actually the cost of staying in college. To take a class that I didn&rsquo;t even need I would have to spend around $25000. To travel the world for 3.5 months would be less than half that amount. I think the choice was clear. I was going to pursue a different type of education.</p>

<h2 id="on-adventures">On Adventures</h2>

<ul>
<li>2 near-death experiences in Thailand: one on a motorbike and one during a diving excursion</li>
<li>Seeing a friend in college at some random Muey Thai gym in Chiang Mai.</li>
<li>The craziest 48 hours of my life during the Full Moon Party in Koh Phangnan</li>
<li>Met up with two people from SAD (Korea and Madrid)</li>
<li>Random road trip from Barcelona -&gt; Madrid, stopping by 5 euro AYCE spanish BBQ.</li>

<li>Berlin Techno. No words, only vibrating organs here.</li>
<li>Actually ended up being photographed for a Berlin Techno art project after leaving Kater Blau at 1pm. That&rsquo;s my profile picture.</li>
<li>Went to a villa party in Koh Tao and met the overall directors of diving in Asia, along with all the ming dynasty vases they rescued from shipwrecks</li>
<li>Dog Bar Dog Bar Dog Bar Dog Bar Dog Bar in Prague (its called dog bar because theres a dog in the bar)</li>
<li>A perfect day in Venice with a girl I met on the street (straight out of a romcom&hellip;seriously)</li>

</ul>

<h2 id="on-asian-american-identity-dot">On Asian-American Identity.</h2>

<p>I was originally born in Fremont, California and went to school at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh. All my life I was surrounded by diversity&hellip;too much diversity, in fact. All my friends were Asians&hellip;more specifically Asian-American. Something about traveling makes you hyperaware of your own racial identity.</p>
