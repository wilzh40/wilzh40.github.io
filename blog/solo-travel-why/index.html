<h2 id="context">Context</h2>

<p>I recently embarked on a journey circumnavigating the world from 1/3/19 to 4/15/19.
This blog post serves as a way to unpackage all the thoughts floating rent-free in my head, patiently waiting to be captured by the written word. It also serves as some sort of guide to future solo travelers (and my colleagues) who have asked me to document some of my findings in my trip, so that they would not repeat the same mistakes I did. Lastly, it is some cathartic release for me to relive some of the memories as I sit here, drinking my $3.95 Gibraltar at one of the only hipster coffee shops in Fremont. The content is prosaic, kind of a stream-of-consciousness rant, so please forgive me in advance for all the grammarly offences within the next couple pages.</p>

<h2 id="the-motivation-why-solo-travel">The Motivation: Why Solo Travel?</h2>

<p>Solo Travel? Who the fuck does that? Do you have no friends? Aren&rsquo;t you gonna get lonely? It took a lot of baby steps and twists of fate for me to buy that first airline ticket to Korea.</p>

<h3 id="inception">Inception</h3>

<p>It all started with this little thought in my mind. I was browsing a reddit thread sometime probably in Junior year about the best underrated travel destinations in the world. And one of the top comments was Prague: beautiful, sprawling, old, cheap, and most importantly, unbombed during World War II. That was ground zero: it all started with this childlike inkling of desire to see Prague. But none of my friends wanted to see Prague. I brought it up in passing conversation. So I shelved that thought for a couple years.</p>

<h3 id="getting-tired-of-pittsburgh">Getting tired of Pittsburgh</h3>

<p>I was going through a conundrum sometime in the middle of November. I had just confirmed with my advisor that I had all of the required units to graduate one semester only. I originally had the naive thought that I would stay another semester part-time at CMU, thinking of course it was my senior spring. Instead, I would do research and take one high-level CS course in order to stay part-time and enrolled, preferably something that can prepare me for my upcoming job (C++). That being said, I could still participate in Greek life and go to bars every Thursday, Friday, and Saturday, stumbling from Hofbrauhouse to Tiki Lounge to eventually one of the more degenerate (and never well-remembered) bacchanal known as Jimmy D&rsquo;s. On Fridays I would go to the Hidden Harbour happy hour and probably Mario&rsquo;s in Shadyside. On Saturdays, well, probably a frat party or two and then Tequila Cowboy. Rinse and repeat and rinse and repeat and so it goes. Cheap beer and top 40 and always ordering Dominoes by the end of the night.
I wasn&rsquo;t neccesarily sick of Pittsburgh, but I definitely sampled basically everything the steel city had to offer. I had also accomplished most of my goals in college: I had a job, I passed all my classes, and I had a fairly diverse life outside of school. I was spiritually ready to leave.</p>

<h3 id="youth">Youth</h3>

<p>Another thing I was slowly was growing conciouss of was the ephemeral nature of youth. Time is the most valuable thing: youth is definitely wasted on the young. I had the opportunity to visit various alumni when I was interviewing for tech jobs in both San Francisco and Seattle.</p>

<h3 id="forcing-my-hand">Forcing my hand</h3>

<p>Sometime during mid-November, I was clutching and ice-cold bottle of Ace Pear Cider (top-tier beverage) at a late night gathering, eating smashed potato pizza. And I lost odds. Odds to just say &ldquo;fuck it and travel the world.&rdquo; Odds out of 3. I felt like the universe was definitely sending me a message. So I instead of this abstraction I would sometimes daydream about while doing my CS homework, it suddenly became real. I started researching logistics. I started lurking in some travel communities, such as /r/solotravel. I called Fletcher (the only one who had the balls to do something similar) and interrogated him on his experience. And then I realized, this was totally within the realm of possibility.</p>

<h3 id="tuition">Tuition</h3>

<h2 id="on-hostel-life">On hostel life</h2>

<h2 id="on-safety">On safety</h2>

<h2 id="on-being-asian-american">On Being Asian American</h2>

<p>I was originally born in Fremont, California and went to school at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh. All my life I was surrounded by diversity&hellip;too much diversity, in fact. All my friends were Asians&hellip;more specifically Asian-American. Something about traveling makes you hyperaware of your own race.</p>
