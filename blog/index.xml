      <description>Context I recently embarked on a journey circumnavigating the world from 1/3/19 to 4/15/19. By writing this series of blog posts, I hope to accomplish several things:

If I don&amp;rsquo;t write these down, they&amp;rsquo;re going to fade away. It also serves as some sort of guide to future solo travelers (and my colleagues) who have asked me to document some of the findings on my trip, so that they would not repeat the same mistakes I did.</description>
