      <title>Solo Travel: Why?</title>

      <description>Context I recently embarked on a journey circumnavigating the world from 1/3/19 to 4/15/19. By writing this series of blog posts, I hope to accomplish several things:
 This blog post serves as a way to unpackage all the thoughts floating rent-free in my head, patiently waiting to be captured by the written word. If I don&amp;rsquo;t write these down, they&amp;rsquo;re going to fade away. It also serves as some sort of guide to future solo travelers (and my colleagues) who have asked me to document some of the findings on my trip, so that they would not repeat the same mistakes I did.</description>

      <description>On a bored Saturday, I realized that my old website (with all my iOS app descriptions and occasionally cringey high school blog posts) died when I spilled a cup of free coffee I got from the 6th floor of the Gates-Hillman center at CMU.
Most expensive cup of coffee in my life.
Now that I have a brand new laptop and hopefully much better coffee control, I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to create a new website.</description>
